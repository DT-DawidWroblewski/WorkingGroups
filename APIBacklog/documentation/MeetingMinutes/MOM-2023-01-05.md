| **Agenda  Item**  |  Owner| Description |
| ----------- | --- | ----------- |
| **Recent updates & recap** | | 
|  | TEF | The new WoW as to API backlog WG is to be updated, by i) defining one single pipeline, and ii) consolidating all info as to API lifecycle into one single table, following recommendation from CAMARA chairman. | 
| **Current issues** |  |  |
|  [#57](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/57)  | TEF | **API proposal pipeline: from API backlog to SteerCo approval**<br> The proposal has been presented to the WG participants, with the aim of collecting feedback. <br>The proposal has been shared in XLS format, though it has been clarified that it will be posted in Github (once agreed) as .MD <br> General ok on the new structure, to provide audience with consolidated info centralized into one single table. However, some recommendations/suggestions were proposed as to capturing info on API deployment across different OBs:<li>The 'production environment' wording can be misinterpreted -- add a note to clarify its meaning or simply remove it <li>There is a probelm to link API versions to actual production env, since it is an operator decision. Market issue. <li> If an API version is deployed at a given OB network, include a link to the operator portal where the API version is accesible <br><br> API backlog leader feeds CAMARA chairman back with the proposed changes, with the aim of generating a stable proposal that allows closing the issue |
