| **Current issues** |  |  |
|  [#57](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/57)  | TEF | **API proposal pipeline: from API backlog to SteerCo approval**<br> This issue has been traslated into: [PR#134](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/134) (closed) and [PR#65](https://github.com/camaraproject/Governance/pull/65) (open, in Governance).  |
| [#153](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/153)  | TEF | **New API proposal: Blockchain Public Address**</br> This issue is associated with [PR#154](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/154). This PR includes: <br><li> [API family proposal](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/154/files#diff-bc4cef8af2ee8790fd4d796a87bf7d198a1c7439fd79c75ed535276b13048fac) </li><li>[YAML](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/pull/154/files#diff-bc4cef8af2ee8790fd4d796a87bf7d198a1c7439fd79c75ed535276b13048fac) <br> Updated, addressing initial setVodafone initial set of comments. GSMA still as supporter, and Vodafone are pending to revisit the updated proposal (AP 20230427-01).| 
| **Closed issues** |  |  |
| [#152](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/152)  | TEF | **Update API backlog table**</br> Updated with GSMA as supporter.| 
| **New issues** |  | |
| [#192](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/issues/192)  | TelecomXChange | **Proposal for a New API for E.212/E.164 Mapping**</br> It was been requested to submit the API proposal to start the formal procedure. <br> **Vodafone**: not sure whether the proposal from TelecomXChange is to either A) produce a single implementation and make it available for CAMARA community; or B) work out a solution together with other CSPs. Vodafone prefer option A, because it reduces the entropy (i.e., multiple implementations are possible, and each CSP might prefer a different one). With option A, we can decide later on who will be the solution host, e.g. GSMA <br> **Orange**: agree with Vodafone. Robert will sync with Patrice. <br> **TEF**: Second Vodafone's position. Will also reach out to TelecomXChange (AP 20230427-02).
