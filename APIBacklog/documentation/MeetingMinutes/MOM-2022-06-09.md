## Discussion
| Agenda Item | Who | Description |
| ----------- | --- | ----------- |
| **CURRENT ISSUES** |  | **Total: 11 [ Open: 9 (3 new), Closed: 2 ]** |
| Issue #12<br>*-Change for API backlog* | Ericsson | \* TEF: some comments were proposed in the thread. Request for updates taking into account OPAG's API backlog -> [https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/Contributions/API%20backlog%20proposal%20for%20change.pdf](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/Contributions/API%20backlog%20proposal%20for%20change.pdf) <br>\* Slide 2.<br><ul><li>VF: agree with Ericsson proposal on the approach, focus more on use case driven capabilities rather than the actual technology solution (network slicing).</li><li>TEF: also agree with VF and Ericsson. TEF suggest the need to map the four bullets to the OPAG defined topics in the backlog, in order to manage expectations in terms of priorities (unrealistic to have them all ready in the same timeline). TEF also asks for clarification on the relationship of the first bullet (service ordering with SLA requirements) with the QoD API already posted in CAMARA.&nbsp;</li><li>**Related Action Points: 20220526-01, 20220526-02**</li></ul>\* Slide 4. <br><ul><li>VF: struggled to find the actual use case behind geofencing.</li><li>Ericsson has explained a possible use case.&nbsp;</li><li>All: We are not sure who originally proposed this API family.</li></ul>\* Slide 5.<br><ul><li>TEF: It'd be good to compare to this API famility to OPAG backlog, and identify matching/mis-matching.</li><li>Ericsson agrees.</li><li>**Related Action Points: 20220526-01**</li></ul>\* Slide 6.<br><ul><li>TEF: before removing traffic influence, it'd be interesting to understand what traffic influence API means for OPAG. In the OPAG backlog, traffic influence (priority #5), which is separate from Application onboarding and instance management (priority #1) and QoS management (priority #3).&nbsp;</li><li>**Related Action Points: 20220526-03**</li></ul>**Update 9th June:** No progress on this issue since meeting on 25th May|
| Issue #2<br>*\- Add Item for Hybrid Cloud Architecture in Context of Hyperscalers* | Dell | \* DELL: The intention is to standardize API's specifically service API's consumed by Edge App providers and that can be unanimously used by hyperscalers a well<br>\* DT: CAMARA intention is precisely to work on this. <br>\* VF: VF has worked on other initiatives dealing with this problem, with APIs suitable for app developers in telco edge cloud environements. <br>\* TEF: Telco Edge APIs will be available in CAMARA repository by the end of May or first week of June.<br>\* **Related Action Points: 20220512-01**<br><br>**Update 9th June:** Dell did not attend the meeting to give an update on this issue. As the EdgeCloud working group now active, suggestion is to transfer this issue there and close it in Backlog |
| Issue #20<br>*\- Add new endpoint in QoD API to request available qos\_prfoiles?* |  | When do we expect to have this capability?<br>**Conclusion: periodically check with Marcin the roadmap of this capability, and inform us when available, so the issue can be closed.**<br><br>**Update 9th June:** An identical issue is open within the QoD WG, so agreement was to close this issue here |
| *Issue #21* <br>*\- How verification for authorized recipient \(e\.g\. UE\) impacts existing QoD API* | DT | It makes reference to QoD#8, which in in turn makes reference to commonalities WS and it is tagged with 'QoD-backlog'<br>How to handle this?<br>**Conclusion: close this issue**<br><br>**Update 9th June:** Issue has now been closed |
| *Issue #29* <br>*\- API to request the status of the network* | Scenera | \* Scenera: From previous PoCs it is possible for the network to provide an indication of its congestion and performance. <br>\* TEF: What is the relation to IETF's L4S framework?<br><br>**Update 9th June:** Scenera presented the uploaded [proposal](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/Contributions/API%20Proposals/Network%20Status%20API.md) for a "Network Status API". Use case is clear - providing a indication of network connectivity status to a management system for cellular-connected video cameras to allow video quality optimisation. Devices would be identified by GPSI. Main discussion was on the nature of the network status indicator.<li> The indicator would need to give an indication of : <ul><li> Expected device throughput <li> Expected device latency <li> Cell congestion </ul><li> Indicators could be absolute (e.g. Mb/s, ms) or relative (e.g. good, average, poor) as appropriate <li> Values should take into account any priority that the device would get for its tarrif <br><br> **Proposals for network status indicators should be discussed within the issue itself** |
| *Issue #30*<br>*\- API to Route Traffic to a Specific Slice on the Network* | Scenera | \* Scenera: xxx<br>\* TEF:Is this API consumed at provisioning time, or can be at operation time? We need first to clarify URSP and OS supported service categories (GSMA and 3GPP working on this).<br><br>**Update 9th June:** Scenera presented the uploaded [proposal](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/Contributions/API%20Proposals/Selective%20Traffic%20Routing%20on%20Slice.md) for routing based on network slicing. The purpose of using slicing was to give priority to some traffic over others. There appears to be some overlap in this use case with that being considered by the QoD WG. Scenera agreed to discuss this proposal in the QoD WG to see if this use case could be accomodated by that API <br><br>**Proposal: Close this issue here if this use case can be accomodated by the QoD API**|
| **NEW ISSUES** |  |  |
| Issue #x<br>\- LS Reply to OPAG on backlog proposal | Ericsson, TEF | To prepare a LS reply to OPAG, to provide them with feedback on their CAMARA backlog proposal. This LS will be prepared once APs 20220526-01, 20220526-02 and 20220526-03 are closed. <br><br>**Update 9th June:** Issue not yet created. Waiting to close action points |
| Issue #43 <br> Roaming Status API Proposal | Vodafone | Vodafone presented a [proposal](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/Contributions/API%20Proposals/Roaming%20Status.md) for a Roaming Status API. Main discussion was on privacy and authorisation : <ul><li> How to ensure that the subscriber whose roaming status is being reported has consented to that? <li> How to ensure that the API consumer has the right to access that information? </ul> **Proposal:** These issues will be common to many APIs, so should be considered by the Commonalities WG. Other questions and comments on the specific API proposal can be added to issue #43 |
| Issue #44 <br> Device Identifier API Proposal | Vodafone | Vodafone presented a [proposal](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/Contributions/API%20Proposals/Device%20Identifier.md) for a Device Identifier API based on the IMEI, which is known to the network. Main discussion was on : <ul><li> The value in providing an option to identify the device manufacturer only, rather than IMEI or IMEI TAC <li> The overall value of this API to a business case </ul> **Proposal:** Discuss further within issue #44 |
| Issue #45 <br> Anonymised Subscriber Identifier API Proposal | Vodafone | Vodafone presented a [proposal](https://github.com/camaraproject/WorkingGroups/blob/main/APIBacklog/documentation/Contributions/API%20Proposals/Anonymised%20Subscriber%20Identifier.md) for an Anonymised Subcriber Identifier API, which would provide an anonymised identifier for the connectivity subscriber (i.e. SIM owner) based on the public IP address currently alloacted to the UE using that SIM. Main discussion was on : <ul><li> Clarification that this was an identity use case and not authentication as the end user may not be the subscriber themselves (e.g. mobile routers) <li> Privacy / authorisation issues as discussed above </ul> **Proposal:** WG participants to discuss proposal internally and add any comments or question to issue #45 |
