| API name | Home Devices Prioritization (a.k.a. QoS WiFi) |
| API owner | Telefónica |
| API summary | **High level description**<br>It may be useful for applications to request the prioritization of an specific device traffic on the user home network. Setting the device prioritization would guarantee certain QoS (Quality of Service) among other devices connected to same home network improving user experience in the application running on the prioritized device.<br>For example, device prioritization capability could be useful in scenarios such as:<li>A user using head-mounted display device for VR/AR applications which is prioritized in user home router to improve the user experience. VR/AR applications require high bandwidth for the big amount of data to be streamed.</li><li>A user using VoIP application in a home device which is prioritized in order to have lower latency (improving call quality or avoiding dropped calls).</li><br>**Input params**<br><li>Unique identifier of the user the home network belongs to i.e. unique identifier of the user within the operator providing the internet service to the home.</li><li>DSCP (Differentiated Services Code Point) value used to prioritize traffic of the target home device. </li></li>Internal IP address of the connected device in the home network. </li></li>Public IP address identifying the target home network (router external IP address).</li><br><br>**Output params**<br>No output is provided beyond the success/error response confirming whether prioritization has been successfully applied or not. <br><br>**Notifications** <br>No notifications are required for this API <br><br>**Notes**<br>User consent will be required for the application to prioritize the device traffic. |
| Technical viability | This API requires support of Differentiated services (DiffServ) on home network routers as mechanism for classifying and managing network traffic and providing quality of service (QoS). | 
| Commercial viability | Today, there does not exist a commercial nor industrialized open source solution that can be applied and implemented in 100% of CPEs currently deployed on field worldwide.  The reason is that any open-source or commercial solution will be dependent on the capabilities and standard DCSP codes support at SoC/WiFi chipset level; and as of today, its applicability on them is minority. For example, open source solutions like OpenSync (promoted by Plume) are only available for a quite of few SoC/WiFi chipset models of some vendors.|
